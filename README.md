- The pagination feature was implemented for item 5 via infinite scrolling with page size = 5. See the source code for details.

Release Notes
======
- The application works in instagram sandbox mode (this is the only option that instagram gives you until your app is reviewed by them). Thatâ€™s why the instagram API gives us a very limited subset of media. It works only for sandbox users invited to this application. 

- For testing this solution you need to create your own instagram test account, with a new API key.  Use client_credentials.xml to put API key and your callback Uri into there.  Create a second instagram account and make it a sandbox user for the app (and connect the 2nd user to your initial instagram test account) and post some media in the tested location area. 

- The app was built using latest android studio 3.0 Canary 9. It supports min SDK version 23.
